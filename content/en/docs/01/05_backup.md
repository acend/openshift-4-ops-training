In this lab, you will create scheduled backups for the most important cluster components.


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1: Create user workload backups

As a cluster admin, you can create scheduled backups of your users' resources. This allows you to restore them in cases like an accidental deletion.

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
You will be using Velero to create user workload backups.
{{% /alert %}}

Setup a daily backup of the resources in namespace `uptime-app-prod` with a lifetime of 10 days by creating the following schedule:

{{< highlight yaml >}}{{< readfile file="content/en/docs/01/resources/schedule_daily-backup-uptime-app-prod.yaml" >}}{{< /highlight >}}

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
This resource file is also available at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acend/openshift-4-ops-training/main/content/en/docs/01/resources/schedule_daily-backup-uptime-app-prod.yaml.
{{% /alert %}}

```bash
oc -n training-infra-velero apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acend/openshift-4-ops-training/main/content/en/docs/01/resources/schedule_daily-backup-uptime-app-prod.yaml
```

The schedule will create the first backup immediately. Have a look at the status part of the backup:

```bash
oc -n training-infra-velero describe backup | grep -A 9 Status
```

The output should look similar to this:

```
Status:
  Completion Timestamp:  2021-04-14T09:31:11Z
  Expiration:            2021-04-24T09:30:50Z
  Format Version:        1.1.0
  Phase:                 Completed

    Total Items:      31
  Start Timestamp:    2021-04-14T09:30:50Z
  Version:            1
```


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2 Create etcd backup

To be able to restore the cluster in case of a disaster, you will create a scheduled `etcd` backup.

Create a new project to be used for the backup:

```bash
oc new-project training-infra-etcd-backup
```

Since `etcd` is running on the masters, we need to make sure the cronjob pods creating the `etcd` snapshots are running on a master as well. We can do this by adding the following annotation:

```bash
oc patch namespace training-infra-etcd-backup -p \
    '{"metadata":{"annotations":{"openshift.io/node-selector": "node-role.kubernetes.io/master="}}}'
```

For the cronjob pod to be able to access the `etcd` files, we need to create a service account with additional permissions by attaching a custom `SecurityContextConstraints` (SCC) policy:

* Service account:

{{< highlight yaml >}}{{< readfile file="content/en/docs/01/resources/etcd-backup/sa_etcd-backup.yaml" >}}{{< /highlight >}}

* SCC:

{{< highlight yaml >}}{{< readfile file="content/en/docs/01/resources/etcd-backup/scc_privileged-etcd-backup.yaml" >}}{{< /highlight >}}

```bash
oc -n training-infra-etcd-backup apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acend/openshift-4-ops-training/main/content/en/docs/01/resources/etcd-backup/sa_etcd-backup.yaml
oc -n training-infra-etcd-backup apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acend/openshift-4-ops-training/main/content/en/docs/01/resources/etcd-backup/scc_privileged-etcd-backup.yaml
```

Now we can create the secret containing the AWS credentials and S3 bucket configuration:

```bash
oc -n training-infra-etcd-backup apply -f /home/ec2-user/ocp4-ops/resources/etcd-backup/secret_etcd-backup-s3-bucket.yaml
```

Finally we can create the `ConfigMap` containing the backup script and the `CronJob` resources. Here's what they look like:

{{< highlight yaml >}}{{< readfile file="content/en/docs/01/resources/etcd-backup/cm_backup-script.yaml" >}}{{< /highlight >}}

{{< highlight yaml >}}{{< readfile file="content/en/docs/01/resources/etcd-backup/cronjob_etcd-backup.yaml" >}}{{< /highlight >}}

Create them with:

```bash
oc -n training-infra-etcd-backup apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acend/openshift-4-ops-training/main/content/en/docs/01/resources/etcd-backup/cm_backup-script.yaml
oc -n training-infra-etcd-backup apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acend/openshift-4-ops-training/main/content/en/docs/01/resources/etcd-backup/cronjob_etcd-backup.yaml
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
In our example of the `CronJob` the backup job is started every six hours. If you do not want to wait that long, change the schedule of the `CronJob` accordingly.
Or you can trigger the job manually with `oc create job --from=cronjob/etcd-backup -n training-infra-etcd-backup etcd-test-job`
{{% /alert %}}

You can verify the backup job by looking at the result or by checking the logs of the pod:

* Job status:

```bash
oc -n training-infra-etcd-backup get jobs
```

* Check the logs:

```bash
oc -n training-infra-etcd-backup logs jobs/<job-name>
```

The logs should not contain any errors and should show the successful upload of the backup to the S3 bucket:
