In chapter 3 you got to know the monitoring components, its rules and more.
Now, imagine you get an alert.
"Where to begin?", you ask.
How do you find out what's amiss and led to the alert?

That's what we are going to look at in this first lab.


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1: Cluster operators

As you already know, OpenShift 4 usually consists of about 30 different operators.
Each operator is responsible that the actual state of the cluster matches the desired, configured state.
If this is not the case, the operator tells us.

Check the cluster operators' state.

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

```bash
oc get clusteroperators
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
For most of the Kubernetes resource types, there's a short version.
In the case of the `clusteroperators` resources, it's `co`, so you could also check the state with `oc get co`.
{{% /alert %}}

This gives you something along the lines of:

The important part to see here is that all of the operators are available, that they are not progressing and that they are not degraded.

If you make a change to one of the operator's configuration, the operator usually changes its progressing state to true as long as the configuration change has not finished.

Degraded means that the operator cannot function properly because there is, e.g., a configuration error.


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2: Configuration error

In order to test this behaviour, we are going to introduce a configuration change.
Specifically, we want to add an authentication provider to our cluster:

{{< highlight yaml >}}{{< readfile file="/content/en/docs/04/resources/oauth_cluster.yaml" >}}{{< /highlight >}}

Apply the authentication provider configuration to the cluster.

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

```bash
oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acend/openshift-4-ops-training/main/content/en/docs/04/resources/oauth_cluster.yaml
```

{{% /details %}}

It might take a while, but after a moment, the authentication operator will change its "degraded" state to true.
Obviously something seems to be wrong with our introduced configuration; it'd be quite the coincidence something else happened at the same time.
But we need to know what exactly, so let's try to find out.

To do that, let's have a closer look at the cluster operator responsible for the oauth configuration, the authentication operator. Execute a `describe` on it and look for a hint on what could be wrong.

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

```bash
oc describe clusteroperator authentication
```

The output will be rather long.
Look for for the `Status` part to see the relevant message:

```
Status:
  Conditions:
    Last Transition Time:  2021-04-23T09:39:40Z
    Message:               OAuthServerConfigObservationDegraded: error validating secret openshift-config/github-secret: secret "github-secret" not found
    Reason:                OAuthServerConfigObservation_Error
    Status:                True
    Type:                  Degraded
    Last Transition Time:  2021-04-22T18:54:38Z
    Message:               All is well
    Reason:                AsExpected
    Status:                False
    Type:                  Progressing
    Last Transition Time:  2021-04-22T18:54:50Z
    Message:               OAuthServerDeploymentAvailable: availableReplicas==2
    Reason:                AsExpected
    Status:                True
    Type:                  Available
```

You can see that the operator's status first changed from "Available" (`Type` field) to "Progressing" and then to "Degraded".
This means that it tried to apply our configuration change but then failed to do so.

Looking at the topmost "Message" reveals the problem:
The configuration defines a secret in `clientSecret` which contains the GitHub client secret.
This secret doesn't exist (on purpose).

{{% /details %}}

Now that you've found out what the problem is and how you can get the relevant troubleshooting information, revert the change so the authentication operator goes back to a functioning state.

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

```bash
oc patch oauth cluster --type merge -p '{"spec": {"identityProviders": []}}'
```

{{% /details %}}


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.3: Node debugging

OpenShift 4 introduces a new capability to debug cluster nodes.
Using `oc debug node/<node name>`, a debug pod is started on the specified node and you get a terminal session in that debug pod.

Let's try this out.
Pick a node of your choosing.

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

```bash
oc get nodes
```

{{% /details %}}

Then, using the node's name, start the debug session.

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

```bash
oc debug node/<node name>
```

{{% alert title="Warning" color="secondary" %}}
Note the `/` between the resource type (`node`) and the name.
The command will error out if you don't write it.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% /details %}}

After a brief moment you are presented with a root shell on the desired node.
However, you're not yet really on the node, you're limited to what the container sees of it.
You need to chroot onto the node before you'll be able to use host binaries. The message that appeared when you opened the debug shell conveniently provides the chroot command for us.

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

```bash
chroot /host
```

{{% /details %}}

If you're not sure whether you're on the node, there are different possibilities to find out, one of which is looking at the release file.

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

```bash
cat /etc/redhat-release
```

If the output says `Red Hat Enterprise Linux release [...]`, you're still contained in the container.
As we know, OpenShift nodes use CoreOS as operating system, so the output should read `Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS release [...]`.

{{% /details %}}

We can now do all the things as if we had connected via ssh.
Which is still possible but might be less convenient.

One of these things you might want to do is have a look at the running containers on that node.
We do this using `crictl`.

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

```bash
crictl ps
```

As you probably know from the good old days when you still used Docker on your machines, `ps` lists all running containers.

{{% /details %}}

`crictl` is also aware of pods, so as a next task, list all pods.

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

```bash
crictl pods
```

{{% /details %}}

To exit the node debug pod, either simply type `exit` or press ctrl+d until you're back on your own shell.

For more information on `crictl`, check out [this debugging how-to](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/crictl/) or [its documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cri-tools/blob/master/docs/crictl.md).


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.4: Node logs

You might be tempted now to use the `oc debug node` feature to use it for all kinds of debugging tasks.
However, there is one particularly useful `oc adm` subcommand that comes in especially handy when you want to look at a node's logs.

`oc adm node-logs` allows you to retrieve node logs.
By default, the command queries the systemd journal.
Using `--path`, you can override this behaviour and use it to show logs within the node's `/var/logs` directory.

Let's use this to query all masters' (`--role master`) kubelet (`--unit`) logs.

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

```bash
oc adm node-logs --role master --unit kubelet --tail 10
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
As with the `journalctl` command you can use `--tail`, `--since` and `--until` to limit the amount of logs or to focus on a certain period of time.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% /details %}}

Of course above command can be used for all the other systemd units that are running on a node.

As already mentioned, the `--path` parameter can be used to show logs in the `/var/logs` directory.
The following command lists all available log directories:

```bash
oc adm node-logs --role master --path /
```

This way, we can find a specific log file and finally show its content, e.g. the audit log's:

```bash
oc adm node-logs --role master --path /audit/audit.log
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
You might have to interrupt the `node-logs` command using `--path` with ctrl+c depending on the number of logs.
The `--tail`, `--since` and `--until` parameters cannot be used to with `--path`.
{{% /alert %}}


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.5: Node resource usage

Belonging to the same category of particularly useful commands is `oc adm top`.
It can be used to display usage statistics of images, imagestreams, nodes and pods.

Want to know which image uses the most space on your nodes?
`oc adm top images` is your friend.
It works very similarly for `ImageStreams` objects.

A command providing you with a nice overview of resource usage on your nodes (without using Prometheus) is `oc adm top node`, which also works with the `--selector` parameter to list all nodes that match the selected label:

```bash
oc adm top node --selector node-role.kubernetes.io/worker
```

Finally, let's check the uptime app's resource consumption:

```bash
oc adm top pods --namespace uptime-app-prod
```


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.6: SSH

You might be wondering why all these new subcommands were introduced with OpenShift 4.
Why not simply ssh into a node you want to analyze?

The reason is the introduction of CoreOS as the default underlying operating system of OpenShift 4.
CoreOS changes the way we interact with an operating system because it follows the core principles of containers:

* immutability
* statelessness

This means that it is discouraged to ssh into a node because this might introduce manual, undocumented changes to the operating system that could lead to unexpected behaviour.
Always apply configuration changes via `MachineConfig` objects instead.

However, there are cases where ssh represents the only viable means of analyzing a malfunctioning node.
Imagine the OpenShift API is down or the node's kubelet is not responding.
`oc` will not work in these cases.
So it still is a good idea to configure ssh keys in those installation configuration files.

In order to connect to any node, first find out the node's hostname.
Fortunately, and this should always be the case, AWS uses the fully-qualified hostnames as node names.
Get a hostname:

```bash
oc get nodes
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
Note that the ssh command will not work! This is due to this training's specific network segmentation.
We added the command for reference nonetheless.
{{% /alert %}}

The only remaining piece left to know about is that you always have to use username `core` when connecting to a CoreOS OpenShift node:

```bash
ssh core@<node name>
```


## Troubleshooting references

The OpenShift documentation has multiple troubleshooting documentation pages such as [this one](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/support/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-installations.html) which are worth checking out.
