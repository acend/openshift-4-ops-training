## Monitoring stack

The external monitoring stack is configured via Helm. By default, the monitoring stack creates an environment for 10 trainees. This can be increased via values.yaml.

The documentation and chart can be found [here](https://github.com/acend/openshift-training-setup/tree/main/uptime-dashboard).
